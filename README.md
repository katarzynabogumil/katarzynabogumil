**Full-Stack Software Engineer, experienced with JavaScript and Python technologies. Skilled in Angular, React, Node, Express, Koa, MongoDB, SQL and Django.**

As a focused and adaptable developer, I thrive on challenges that push me to grow, constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skill set. My ability to think in a modular and organized manner enables me to break down complex problems and deliver efficient solutions. During my prior professional journey as an architect, I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills.
